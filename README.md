## Overview
CU Simulator is a Strategy, point-and-click game featuring a student's journey in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). By going through different events, players can experience the life of a University student in different places of the campus. Plan your upcoming schedule to increase your GPA, Money or Happiness! Venture through CUHK to trigger hidden side-events! But remember, since you are a student, you might have to prepare upcoming exams! 

With different statistics and choices, you can decide different endings for the student. You can also add other players in game as friend to message them in real-time, and boost the statistics together. A friend recommendation system is also available for those who want to find other players along the way.

The expected playtime is 30 mins.

## Objective
To raise freshmen’s interest in real university life and familiarize them with CUHK’s atmosphere, and to connect alumni of CUHK inside/outside the game.

## Background
Our team observed that due to online lessons, freshmen are not familiar with the cultures, traditions, common languages or even places in CUHK. In order to raise their interest in real university lives and familiarize them with CUHK’s atmosphere, we created this education simulation game. Through traveling to different places in CUHK virtually and talking to NPC, or even their friends via messaging systems, we hope they can know more about their own university.

In addition, through this game, we hope to get CUHK alumnis connected. By the real time action functions provided in the game, alumni can meet friends and recall their precious memories in CUHK. They can also try to discover different endings, or do things that they haven't done while they were university students. Some questions require them to go back to CUHK directly in order to get the correct answer, which encourages off-line interactions of alumni.
