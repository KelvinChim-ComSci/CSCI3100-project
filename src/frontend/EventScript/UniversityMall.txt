Every year, there is an Art Fair at the University Mall.
You are taking a walk with Joyce and Ken.
You: Is this the first time you guys have been to the Art Fair?
Joyce: Yes, I missed that when I was year 1.
Ken: Me too. 
You: Shall we go to the stall of the Rowling team to have a look?
Joyce & Ken: Sure!
(Walking to the stall of Rowling team)
Rowling team member: Hey Hey Hey! Come to take a look and try the Rowing machine out!
@QQ@ Do you want to try the Rowing machine?
@A1,2@ Yes
@A2,6@ No
@R1@ After trying the rowing machine, you feel much stronger than beforeâ€¦
@R1@ You: Oh my god! I feel so empowered!
@R1@ After 2 seconds, you know it is just an illusion. However, you decided to do more sports after the trial. (+sport, +happiness)

@R2@ Ken: Let me try it out!
@R2@ Ken seems to be falling in love with Rowing after trying the rowing machine. He even joins the rowing team directly.
