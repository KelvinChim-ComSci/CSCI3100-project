Walking straight on the University Mall, you can see the University Library behind you in less than 30 meters.
In front of you is the famous “Gate of Wisdom”, which stands on the so-called beacon tower. Your friend, Ken, asks you to walk through the gate.
@QQ@Do you want to walk through the gate?
@A1,2@Yes
@A2,5@No
@R1@Ken : haha, actually there is a saying that if you pass through the gate with your back facing the library, you will not be able to graduate. But if you do it in the opposite direction, you will have good grades!

@R2@Ken : haha, how smart you are. Actually there is a saying that if you pass through the gate with your back facing the library, you will not be able to graduate. But if you do it in the opposite direction, you will have good grades!
