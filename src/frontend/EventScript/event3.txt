~Joining committee~
You started to adapt to university life and made some friends, including Ken. 
Recently, they are talking about joining the student committee together. Joyce, a girl you met in one of your major courses, is talking about this.
Joyce: Hey, do you want to join the committee with us? Ken and I have already decided to join that. 
@QQ@ How would you reply?
@A1,4@ No, I need to study and I don’t want to waste time on it. 
@A2,6@ Sorry about that. I am busy with other part time jobs so I may not be able to join. 
@A3,9@ Sure! Shall we discuss this more? 
@A4,11@ No, I need to workout everyday and I plan to join the University Team soon!
