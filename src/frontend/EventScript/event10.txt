~CUHK U team~
One day you were working out in the gym alone. Suddenly, there is a men wearing blue sports t-shirt working towards you.
The man: Hey there, I always see you practicing by yourself in the sport ground, are you a member of any university team?
You: No, I just practice it by myself.
Coach: I am the coach of the track and field university team. Do you want to try out for the track and field university team tonight? You will have fun!
@QQ@ How would you reply?
@A1,2@ Sure! 
@A2,5@ Sorry, I just want to practice by myself. 
@R1@ Coach: Great! See you tonight!
@R1@ At night, you went to the sports ground to try out. You did pretty well and got into the university team. (+sports, +happiness, -money)
