~Foreign competition~
You were training in the gym as usual. Suddenly, there is a group of people near you talking about their competition.
Student A: Oh my god… Is Tom really injured? 
Student B: Yeah… He cannot even walk properly. 
Student A: But the International Collegiate Contest is to be held next month in the US… What should we do? We need one more team member to participate in it…
Student A stares at you while he is talking.
He then walks to you.
Student A: Hey bro, do you want to try it out?
You: What?
Student A: We are one man missing from joining the competition, come and join us!
@QQ@ How would you reply?
@A1,2@ Sure! I would love to.
@A2,4@ No… Sorry that I cannot help. I will be busy next month.
@R1@ You joined them and trained with them for weeks and participated in the competition. Although you lost, you have gained precious experience in it. (+sport, -money)
