You go to Haddon Cave and watch the college sports day with Ken.
Ken: The athletes are so good at longjumping! Everyone can jump for at least 5 meters!
Ken: Hey do you want to join them and play?
You: You must be kidding… this is for the competitors!
Ken: Don't worry! Some of them are doing it for the PE marks. Just sneak in and jump once!
@QQ@ Do you want to try and do a long jump?
@A1,2@ Yes
@A2,6@ No
@R1@ You: Yea why not. But you have to jump with me!
@R1@ Ken: What? Sigh… fine let's go jump and play.
@R1@ You and Ken tries longjumping. Although you only jumped for 4 meters, it is a fun time. (+sport, +happiness)
