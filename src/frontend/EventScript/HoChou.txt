You have a tutorial at YIA today. After you finish the tutorial, you plan to walk to Med can to have lunch with Joyce and Ken. After you ride on the “seven dragons”, which is a series of elevators near YIA.
Suddenly, you saw a cat on the grassland near YIA, namely Ho Chou. 
@QQ@ What would you do?
@A1,2@ Approach him quickly and pat him
@A2,7@ Approach him slowly and pat him
@R1@ The cat is sleeping. 
@R1@ You walk quickly to the cat and try to pat him. However, it seems that his mood is not good today and he runs away.
@R1@ You sigh and feel really sad.
@R1@ You: Seems that today will be an unlucky day. (-happiness)
