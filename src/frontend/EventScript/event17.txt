~Photo Day~
Photo Day is a day for the graduates to take photos with each other in CUHK and keep it as a memory. Ken, Joyce and you plan to take photos at the Pavilion of Harmony, which is located at the New Asia College. 
Joyce: Hey guys, come come come!
Girls always like to take photos.
Ken and you walk straight towards her. A breeze caresses the cheeks, you ask a pedestrian to help you guys take a photo.
Pedestrian: 3, 2, 1, cheers!
With the “click” sound of the camera, Joyce, Ken and you jump up together and wear big smiles on faces. With worries and expectancy in mind, that would indicate that you are close to the end of your university life.
