You are a Year 3 student. It is a fresh start of the new semester.
When you walk past the university station, a girl with glasses comes to you.
Girl: Excuse me, senpai, do you know how to get to the LSK building?
You realize that the girl is a freshman.
You: take bus no.2 from here. 
You lead her to the bus station.
Soon, a school bus arrived. The girl waves at you and smiled.
Girl: Thank you so much senpai, Iâ€™ll never forget you!!!
It's a fresh start of the new semester. (+happiness)
