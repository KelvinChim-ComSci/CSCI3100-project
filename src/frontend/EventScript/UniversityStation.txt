You are a Year 3 student. It is a fresh start of the new semester.
When you walk past the university station, a girl with glasses comes to you.
“Excuse me, senpai, do you know how to get to the LSK building?”
You realize that the girl is a freshman, and you replied
“take bus no.2 from here”. You lead her to the bus station.
Soon, a school bus arrived. The girl waves at you, smiled, and said
“Thank you so much senpai, I’ll never forget you!!!”
It's a fresh start of the new semester.
