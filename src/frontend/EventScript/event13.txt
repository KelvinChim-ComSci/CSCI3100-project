~Exchange~
Scrolling on Instagram, you see that many of your friends have joined different exchange programmes and went to different countries.
You suddenly remember that, the summer exchange programme from OEA and the college are both near the deadline of application.
You meet Joyce when you are thinking about whether to join it or not.
Joyce: Hey (User name), what are you thinking?
You: Great! I was thinking about whether to go on an exchange programme.
Joyce: Oh, I actually applied the one to UK from my college yesterday, Hope that I can get an offer,
You: Oh really? 
@QQ@ What would you do?
@A1,3@ Go on a different exchange programme 
@A2,5@ Apply to the same exchange programme with Joyce
@A3,9@ Do not go for an exchange (unchanged)
@R1@ You tried to apply for the exchange programme, but you didnâ€™t get any offer. (-happiness)

@R2@ You: Oh, I was also planning to go to that school. 
@R2@ Joyce: Really? Hope that we can go there together! 
@R2@ You applied for the same school and got an offer. (+happiness, +gpa)
