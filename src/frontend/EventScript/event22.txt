~Ocamp~
Before the start of year 3, Ken, Joyce and you are discussing the Ocamp in the coming summer. 
Ken: Joyce, Do you want to become the captain in the Ocamp this year?
Joyce: Ahh I guess no. I think I will be doing an internship at that time. How about you?
@QQ@ Do you want to be the captain in the Ocamp?
@A1,2@ Yes
@A2,6@ No
@R1@ You asked the committee members whether you can be the Captain this year. 
@R1@ You are quite familiar with them and they all agree to let you be the Captain.
@R1@ Although it is time consuming and tiring, you had a great time organizing it and have fun with junior students. (+happiness, -money, -GPA)
