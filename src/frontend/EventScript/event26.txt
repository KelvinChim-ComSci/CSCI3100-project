~Med can~
It is another normal day you go to eat at Med can. 
The menu today written on the blackboard is hardly recognizable. When it is your turn to order the food, you feel a bit difficult to choose what you want to eat. 
It is now your turn. The staff there ask you what you want to eat.
@QQ@ What would you do ?
@A1,2@ You: What so ever!
@A2,4@ You: Um… Sorry, please give me a moment.
@R1@ The staff seems to be pleased and give you an extra amount of meat. 
@R1@ Later you were told by Joyce that the staff there does not like students to think for so long since there is always a long queue at Med can. 
@R1@ People then developed the “What so ever” order to speed up the delivery process.(+ hapiness)

@R2@ You take a deep look into the paper and discover that it is really intersting. You spend even more time to study and work on related projects.
