~A0+1?~
After deciding to join the committee, Joyce and you stick together the whole day a lot to prepare for committee issues. You are having dinner with her at the canteen of Chung Chi college.
Joyce: Ahh, it was a busy week. I was worried about whether we can get enough votes for the election so I didn’t sleep well last night.
You: Yea… I was thinking about it too. And it seems that you are tired today and I was a bit worried. Everything will go fine! Don’t spend too much time thinking about it.
Joyce : Thanks a lot. Though there is still much paperwork to be done, I believe we can get it finished soon! It is great to work together with you! 
Haha, by the way, are you close to any girl after you get into the university? Many of my friends got a boyfriend these days!
@QQ@How would you do?
@A1,2@ No… I think I am not interested in this kind of issue.
@A2,6@ Try to ask her if she can be your girlfriend.
@R1@ You: No… I think I am not interested in this kind of issue.
@R1@ Joyce: Oh… That’s fine, everyone has their preference. 
@R1@ You two had a quick dinner and continued to work on the committee issues after that.

@R2@ You: Yea, I am getting closer to a girl these days! I will try to talk with her more too!
@R2@ Joyce : Ohhh really?! Who is that?
@R2@ You: Haha, maybe we can talk a walk at near the Lake Ad Excellentiam and I will tell you more about that.
@R2@ (Walking to the Lake Ad Excellentiam)
@R2@ After walking near the Lake Ad Excellentiam and chatting with Joyce for a while, you take a deep breath, and hold Joyce’s hand.
@R2@ You: Can you be my girlfriend? I like you a lot!
@R2@ Joyce: Ummm. Let me think about it and I will let you know later tonight.
@R2@ After having dinner, she decides to go back home earlier today instead of continuing working. You walk with her to the MTR station. You are nervous about her reply.
@R2@ Joyce : Hey. 
@R2@ You : Yes?
@R2@ Joyce: My answer to your question is YES!
@R2@ After saying so, she turns her head and rushes to the gate. After dazing for a while, you finally recognize that you got your first girlfriend in your life. (+ Happiness)
