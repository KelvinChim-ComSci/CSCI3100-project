~High table dinner~
You have been keeping good relationships with your friends in the same college. One day, you are having lunch with them in the canteen of your college.
Ken: Hey, are you going to join the high table dinner tonight?
You: What? High table dinner?
Ken: Yes! There is a high table dinner regularly and students must join it to fulfill the requirement! Didn’t you join it last year?
You suddenly remember about it. You were not available to attend the high table dinner last year and applied for exemption. 
Ken: Go with me today! It would be fun!
@QQ@ Do you want to go with Ken?
@A1,2@ No
@A2,5@ Yes
@R1@ Ken: Okay, maybe you have dated others. It’s fine.
@R1@ You attended the high table dinner alone and not many people are talking to you.

@R2@ You guys have fun and meet a lot of friends.
