~Starting a business?~
As usual, you are having lunch with Ken and Joyce.
Ken: (User name), have you ever thought of starting your own business? You seem to be earning much more than average university students!
Joyce: Yeah, you always give people an image that you are rich and you have good business sense. I also think you should try to start your own business.
@QQ@ What is your thought?
@A1,2@ You: Actually I am also planning to do so. I am drafting the SOP and a business plan for a startup competition! 
@A2,5@ You: No… I am not that ambitious. 
@R1@ You prepared a business plan and were interviewed by a group of experienced businessmen. 
@R1@ After a month from the interview, you were told that you won in the competition and got 100k funding for starting your own business.

@R2@ Joyce: That’s fine. I think that is also risky to do so though.
