Last week you saw in the mass mail that there is a research seeking for interviewees about academic pressure. You can get $50 after completing this interview. 
Therefore, you went to the Sino Building, which is one of the so-called “Three brothers”. 
You have an interview with a PhD student there. You had a great chat with her. (+money, +happiness)
