One day when you are going to the Chung Chi Student Canteen, walking past Lake Ad Excellentiam, you are stunned by its beautiful scenery. 
Suddenly, you meet Joyce, she is also going to the Chung Chi Canteen to have lunch.
Joyce: Hey! How are you doing?
You: Great! I was just enjoying the view of Lake Ad Excellentiam.
Joyce: Oh I see. Today’s weather is great and the view is nice. Shall we take a walk?
You: Sure!
(Walking to the Lake Ad Excellentiam)
Joyce: Do you know that there are actually many stories about the Lake of Excellentiam?
You: Um… Not really.
Joyce: Let me tell you one! Once upon a time, there was a couple who planned to elope and dated near the Lake Ad Excellentiam at 10 pm. However, the boy didn’t show up and the girl jumped into the lake and became a ghost! Since then, if there is any boy walking past this lake, the girl will ask him what the time is. If the boy answered 10 pm, then the girl will drag him into the Lake!
You: Wow what a sad and scary story!
Joyce: Also, there is also someone who says that if you jump into this Lake, you can travel to another Lake at The University of Hong Kong.
You: Haha, it's like an anywhere door! (+happiness)
