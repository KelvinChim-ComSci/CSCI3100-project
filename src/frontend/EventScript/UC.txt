After you have finished your lunch at UC can, you have a lesson at New Asia. However, you have never been there before. You look at the Google Map and follow the route.
Suddenly, you discover that you are on a winding road, with the words “=> New Asis” on the wall.
You remember that this should be the famous “Couples road”, which joins New Asia and United College. Instead of an official name, it’s name comes from the fact that there were many couples who enjoyed the beautiful view and dated on this road. 
There is also a myth that a single boy and a single girl walking past this route will become couples together.
You take a look at your phone, you have only 3 minutes before the lesson starts. 
Despite the beautiful view, you choose to run to the lecture theater at New Asia and have the lesson.
