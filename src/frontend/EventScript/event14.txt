Mentorship (year 3 sem 2)
You are now a senior student. You received an email and it is hiring mentors for freshmen.
Ken : Oh you received that email too? I plan to join it! Will you?
@QQ@ What will you do?
@A1,2@ Join the programme ( - GPA, + happiness, + money)
@A2,6@ Ignore the programme (unchanged)
@R1@ You: I think I will join it too! Let’s go for it together!
@R1@ Ken: Great! We can form a group of four and play mahjong!
@R1@ You rolled your eyes.

@R2@ You: No… I think I will not have free time to join this.
@R2@ Ken: I see… It is understandable though, are you seeking internships?
@R2@ You: Yes… I need to prepare for it.
