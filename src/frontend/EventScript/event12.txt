~Seeking for internship~
It is going to be your second summer as a CUHK student. And about half of your university life will be over soon. People around are starting to think about their future. While having lunch with Joyce and Ken, you guys are discussing internships.
Joyce: I just got a summer internship offer! It is a famous company. I really hope that I can get a returning offer,
Ken: (sign) I still do not have any reply yet. I have handed in thousands of interviews already… How about you, (User name)?
You didn’t even think about it before.
You: Oh I still haven’t planned for it.
@QQ@ What would you do?
@A1,2@ Start seeking for internship
@A2,5@ Ignore the coming summer internship chances
@R1@ You tried very hard to seek an internship, and you have got a very good position in the same company as Joyce.
@R1@ You two worked together and got a returning offer from the company. (+GPA, +happiness, +money)

@R2@ You plan to do nothing in the summer.
